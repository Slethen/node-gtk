# node-gtk
GNOME Gtk+ bindings for NodeJS


### What is this
A work in progress to bring Gtk+ usable directly from nodejs so that the environment would be more up-to-date and supported than the one available via [GJS](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Gjs).

Please note this project is currently in an _alpha_ state and it needs more contributors.


### Target Platforms (so far)
We're planning to serve pre-built binaries in order to make this project as cross platform and easy to install as possible.
However, right now we support only **Linux** and experimentally **OSX** but in both targets _the project will falback to build_.


#### Common dependencies
In order to clone, install, and build this project you'll need a working copy of _git_ CLI, _nodejs 5_, _npm_, and python2.
In the _not-working-yet_ Windows platform, all dependencies must be available under [MSYS2 shell](https://msys2.github.io).


### How to build on Ubuntu

Be sure `node` is version **5** or higher.
Ignore the following step iv `node --version` is already _5_ or higher.

```sh
# setup node v5
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -
```

Install basic dependencies.

```sh
# install dependencies
sudo apt-get install \
  build-essential git \
  nodejs \
  gobject-introspection \
  libgirepository1.0-dev
```

At this point `npm install node-gtk` should already install, fallback and build `node-gtk` without problems.


### How to build on ArchLinux

The following should be the bare minimum to be able to build the project.

```sh
pacman -S --needed \
  base-devel git \
  nodejs npm \
  gtk3 gobject-introspection
```

Feel free to install all `base-devel` utilities.

After installing those packages, `npm install node-gtk` would do.


### How to build on OSX
Assuming you have [brew](http://brew.sh) installed, the following has been successfully tested on El Captain.

```sh
# basic dependencies to build this repo
brew install git node gtk+3
```

At this point `npm install node-gtk` should already install, fallback and build `node-gtk` without problems.


### Testing the project

If you'd like to test everything builds and work properly, find a target to clone this project, then run `npm install`.

```sh
# clone and build
git clone https://github.com/WebReflection/node-gtk.git
cd node-gtk
npm install

# how to verify from node-gtk folder
./examples/hello-gtk.js
```
If you'll see a little window saying hello that's it: it works!

Please note in OSX the window doesn't automatically open above other windows.
Try Cmd + Tab if you don't see it.

#### browser demo

If you'd like to test `./examples/browser.js` you'll need [WebKit2 GTK+](http://webkitgtk.org/) libary.

  * in **Ubuntu**, you can `apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-3.0` (`4.0`   works too) and try it out.
  * in **ArchLinux**, you can `pacman -S --needed webkitgtk` and try it out.
  * in **OSX**, there is no way to run it right now because `webkitgtk` was removed from homebrew

Once installed, you can `./examples/browser.js google.com` or any other page, and you might try the _dark theme_ out too:

```sh
# OSX needs to have the Adwaita theme installed
# brew install adwaita-icon-theme

# executable          url         theme
./examples/browser.js google.com  dark
```


### Experimental platforms

Following how to setup the configuration to at least try building this project.


#### How to install node 5.x in Ubuntu 16 LTS
The setup file might not recognize `xenial` platform.
In this case you need to download the file and edit it.

```bash
# download the file
curl -L -O https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x

# edit (use vi or gedit or whatever you like) 
gedit setup_5.x

# find the following line
DISTRO=$(lsb_release -c -s)
# and change it to
DISTRO=jessie


# save the file and run the following
cat setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -

# once done you can
rm setup_5.x
```

At this point you can `apt-get install nodejs` and follow same instructions used for Ubuntu.


#### How to build on Windows (experimental)
Mandatory dependency is _[Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)_ or _Express_ with a C++ compiler (open a new C++ project and install it via IDE if necessary).

The easiest/tested way to at least try building this repository is within a _MinGW shell_ provided by the [MSYS2 installer](https://msys2.github.io/).

Once VS and its C++ compiler is available and MSYS2 installed, launch the MinGW shell.

```sh
# update the system
# in case of errors, wait for the update to complete
# then close and open again MingW shell
pacman -Syyu --noconfirm

# install git, gtk3 and extra dependencie
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm git mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-{gtk3,gobject-introspection,pkg-config}

# where to put the repository clone?
# pick your flder or use ~/oss (Open Source Software)
mkdir -p ~/oss/
cd ~/oss

# clone node-gtk there
git clone https://github.com/WebReflection/node-gtk
cd node-gtk

# first run might take a while
GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2015 npm install
```
The `GYP_MSVS_VERSION` could be 2010, 2012, 2013 or 2015.
Please verify [which version you should use](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)


#### Possible issue on MinGW shell
In case you are launching the general executable without knowing the correct platform,
the binary path might not be available.

In such case `python` won't be available neither, and you can check via `which python` command.

If not found, you need to export the platform related binary path:

```sh
# example for the 32bit version
export PATH="/mingw32/bin:$PATH"
npm run install
```

This should do the trick. You can also check if there is any python at all via `pacman -Qs python`.

Please remember `python2` is the one needed.


#### known issues building on Windows
Right now there are few gotchas and the build will most likely fail. Please help with a PR if you know how to solve the issue, thank you!
